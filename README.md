# keyforge_proxy_maker
A Python script that generates a proxy deck in 4 pages, ready to print

Requisites : You need to install Python3 and Pillow
Once you have those installed you just need to copy that code into notepad and save it as "keyforge_proxy_maker.py" (or whatever you want to call it, as long as it ends in .py).
Then to run, open up your command prompt (or terminal if you're on a mac), navigate to the directory its saved, and type
python keyforge_proxy_maker.py
It will ask the deck_id and the desired language
where deck_id is the id used for your deck in the URL, such as https://www.keyforgegame.com/deck-details/4b676996-2ac2-4d47-ac3f-1d0682eede6d and language is the first 2 letters of the desired language (en,fr,it,es,de so far)
Then it should output 4 pages ready to print.
On my Brother laser printer scale 60% is the perfect size.
Enjoy !
